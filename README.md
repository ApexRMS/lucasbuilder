# LUCAS Builder - Carbon Budget Model

`lucasbuilder` is the open-source [SyncroSim](https://syncrosim.com/) package to integrate the inputs and outputs from the Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Sector ([CBM-CFS3](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/climate-change/climate-change-impacts-forests/carbon-budget-model), [Kurz et al. 2009](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2008.10.018)) into landscape scale simulations using the [ST-Sim](http://docs.stsim.net/) package.

The package allows users to load outputs from the CBM-CFS3, calculate flow rates by carbon pool based on CBM-CFS3 parameters and user defined temperatures, run spin-up simulations to create initial carbon maps based on forest type and recent disturbance, and generate spatially explicit forecasts of forest carbon under alternative scenarios.
